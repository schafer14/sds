# Cognitive overhead-free software development

My goal is to build a system that requires zero cognitive overhead to build 
software. That means every component I use should be so simple that I do not 
need to look anything up to develop. I should be able to build a component
without access to the interent or godoc. Furthermore, I should not need to make
any decisions about structure or testing. The system should have a predefined 
spot for every type of code.

I should also be able to run and interact with this system locally without the
internet or documentation. I should be able to do all this from inside my 
terminal because that's where I live. I should not need to access any documentation
to determine request bodys or specifications.
